    <p>
      Web design refers to the design of websites. It usually refers to the user
      experience aspects of website development rather than software
      development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for
      desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and
      tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important. <br />
      Web designers use various tools and technologies to create visually
      appealing and user-friendly websites. These tools include graphic design
      software such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Sketch, and Figma.
      They also use programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
      bring their designs to life on the web.
